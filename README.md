# Python Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is used to **track and showcase consistent programming practice**.

The purpose of this project is **not** to demonstrate advanced or production-level code. Instead, it serves as a transparent record of ongoing learning, experimentation, and hands-on repetition across different concepts and tools.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

* To build the habit of coding regularly
* To document learning progress over time
* To experiment freely without concern for polish or optimization
* To maintain a visible history of practice and growth

This repository reflects **process over performance**.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

* Practice scripts and small exercises
* Exploratory code and experiments
* Notes, drafts, and iterations
* Incomplete or evolving implementations

Code quality and structure may vary intentionally, as this repo prioritizes **learning through doing**.

---

## Expectations

* This is **not** production-ready software
* There is **no guarantee of consistency** across files
* Patterns, approaches, and styles may change as learning progresses

---

## How This Repository Is Used

* Code is written locally and committed regularly
* Changes reflect practice sessions rather than finished features
* Commits are intentionally frequent and descriptive

---

## License

## Notes

If you are reviewing this repository, it is best viewed as a **learning log** rather than a portfolio project.

---

*Practice compounds over time.*
